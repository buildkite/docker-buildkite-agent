# Docker Images for buildkite-agent

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/5ab4d67e882c6ab2cf988790ec23f13c1913ebb9aaee2502d2.svg)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/docker-buildkite-agent)

Docker images for the [Buildkite Agent](https://github.com/buildkite/agent). 

> If you don't need to run the agent on a purely Docker-based operating system (such as Kubernetes), and instead just want to [run your builds inside Docker containers](https://buildkite.com/docs/guides/docker-containerized-builds), then we recommend using one of the standard installers (such as `apt`). See the [containerized builds guide](https://buildkite.com/docs/guides/docker-containerized-builds) for more information.

The Buildkite Agent is built on Alpine Linux, and available via the following docker image tags:

* `buildkite/agent:2` - 2.x releases
* `buildkite/agent:3` - 3.x releases (beta)
* `buildkite/agent:edge` - Edge releases (master branch)

Included in the image are `docker 1.13 (client)`, `docker-compose 1.10.0`, `tini`, `su-exec` and `jq`.

## Usage

```bash
docker run buildkite/agent:3 --help
```

## Versioning

The default tag (i.e. `buildkite/agent` and `buildkite/agent:latest`) will always point to the latest stable release (currently 2.x, but will change to 3.x once 3.0.0 is released).

We recommend you use `buildkite/agent:3` for new setups.

If you want to use an exact version of Buildkite Agent you can use the corresponding tag, such as `buildkite/agent:3.0-beta.16`.

## Configuring the agent

Most [agent configuration settings](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/configuration) can be set with environment variables. Setting sensitive data, (such as the agent token) via environment variables or command line arguments _is not recommended_ as they are exposed in commands such as `docker inspect`.

In addition to environment variables, you can copy or mount a configuration file to `/buildkite/buildkite-agent.cfg`, for example:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -v "$HOME/buildkite-agent.cfg:/buildkite/buildkite-agent.cfg:ro" \
  buildkite/agent:3
```

## Adding hooks

You can add [custom agent hooks](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/hooks) by mounting or copying them into the `/buildkite/hooks` directory (and ensuring they are executable).

For example, this is how you'd mount the hooks directory using a read-only host volume:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -v "$HOME/buildkite-hooks:/buildkite-hooks:ro" \
  buildkite/agent:3
```

Alternatively, if you create your own image based off `buildkite/agent`, you can copy your hooks into the correct location:

```dockerfile
FROM buildkite/agent

ADD hooks /buildkite/hooks/
```

## Exposing build secrets into the container

There are many approaches to exposing secrets to Docker containers. In addition, many Docker platforms have their own methods for exposing secrets. If youâ€™re running your own Docker containers, we recommend using a read-only [host volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume).

The following example mounts a directory containing secrets on the host machine (`$HOME/buildkite-secrets`) into the container as a read-only data volume at `/buildkite-secrets`:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -v "$HOME/buildkite-secrets:/buildkite-secrets:ro" \
  buildkite/agent:3
```

You can then use an `environment` [agent hook](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/hooks) to expose those secrets via environment variables, or to configure tools such as `git` or `ssh`.

## Authenticating private git repositories

To configure a [git-credentials file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store#_storage_format) located at `/buildkite-secrets/git-credentials`, you could use the following `environment` [agent hook](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/hooks) mounted to `/buildkite/hooks/environment`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

git config --global credential.helper "store --file=/buildkite-secrets/git-credentials"

# You can export other secrets here too
# export FOO=bar
```

To configure a private SSH key located at `/buildkite-secrets/id_rsa_buildkite_git` you could use the following `environment` [agent hook](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/hooks) mounted to `/buildkite/hooks/environment`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -k /buildkite-secrets/id_rsa_buildkite_git

# You can export other secrets here too
# export FOO=bar
```

Other options for configuring Git and SSH include:

* Running `ssh-agent` on the host machine and mounting the ssh-agent socket into the containers. See the [Buildkite Agent SSH keys documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/ssh-keys) for examples on using ssh-agent.
* The least-secure approach: the built-in [docker-ssh-env-config](https://github.com/buildkite/docker-ssh-env-config) support allows you to pass in keys via environment variables.

## Invoking Docker from within a build

To invoke Docker from within builds you'll need to mount the Docker socket into the container:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  buildkite/agent:3
```

Note that this gives builds the same access to the host system as docker has, which is generally root. 

## Entrypoint customizations

The entrypoint uses `tini` to correctly pass signals to, and kill, sub-processes. Instead of redefining `ENTRYPOINT` we recommend you copy executable scripts into `/docker-entrypoint.d/`. All executable scripts should not contain any file extension, and will be executed in alphanumeric order.
